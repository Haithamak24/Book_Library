## Project Overview

The **Book Library** is a web-based application designed to help users manage their personal book collections. It allows users to:

- Add books to their library with details like title, author, and genre.
- Track their reading progress by marking books as **Read** or **Unread**.
- Search for books by title or author.
- Curate a personal library to easily access favorite books.
- Persist data using **localStorage** or an **External API** for saving and retrieving book data.

This project was developed as part of the **Web Preparation Course** with **Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG)**, in collaboration with **Ahmed Asafrah** and guided by **Khaldoun Halawani**.
